## debugger-bundle  
Fork of peter from gluten free's [debug client](https://bitbucket.org/PeterTheEarthling/debugclient/src/master/) 

### main additions
- QOL changes
- combined debug client and simulation into a single project
- teleop
- practice env to simulate a real match  

#### Note: This is my personal sim for FTC 14607, meaning many of the files in simulation/ are edited to our robot and codes' specifications. To use a standalone sim run the standalone.bat file
