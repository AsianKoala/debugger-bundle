### todo

1. test out followcurve
2. add the other smoothing components in gotoposition
3. move follow curve and gotoposition into path and instead mold them together, so that everything is controlled by creating a path, and decide which to use depending on how the path is created through the point constructor for path
5. calculate distance to turn by getting deltaAngle and multiplying it by robotCircumference
